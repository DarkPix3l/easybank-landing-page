Built first with **HTML, CSS & JavaScript**, then refactored with **React + TailwindCSS** for cleaner component-based structure and modern styling.
This project is a solution for a responsive landing page, designed to look as close to the provided design as possible. The goal was to ensure an optimal layout for various screen sizes and provide smooth, interactive hover states for all clickable elements.
